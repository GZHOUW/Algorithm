Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        n = len(citations)
        left = 0
        right = n-1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (right - left)//2 + left
            if n-mid > citations[mid]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid-1
        
        # left will always be the position to start counting h index
        # e.g. [1,2,5,5,5,5], left=2
        return n-left
